# Omnifood-UI-UX-Website
Omnifood is a static website used to design with a major focus on customer well-being through a healthy diet.
Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends,and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for cooking. 
This might lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. I want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. 
Users can use our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual 
weekly meal plan.

This is a code repository for the corresponding live web app - https://omnifood-div.netlify.app/
I used html/css and jquery to build this website.
